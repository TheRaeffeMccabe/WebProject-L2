    <p1>The Luna-class was a type of starship, a reconnaissance science vessel in service to Earth since the late 24th century. The Luna-class ships were the top of the line in Earth's scientific and exploratory pursuits on behalf of NATO.</p1>
    <p2> Each had an average crew of 350 individuals and was approximately 450 meters long. Starfleet designed the Luna-class to accommodate the most diverse crew in the galaxy. By the early 25th century, the successful Luna-class spawned three variants,</p2>
    <p3>Their shuttlebays were reminiscent of the old Constitution-class shuttlebays, having a more rounded opening door. They also featured a longer "runway" for shuttles as they entered and exited the ship.</p3>

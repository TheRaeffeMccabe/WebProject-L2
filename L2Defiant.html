    <p1>The Defiant-class battleship, officially an escort vessel, began development in 2366 as a small, highly powered, heavily armed warship intended to defend NATO against the Boog. The USS Defiant (NX-74205) was the prototype of what was to be a new NATO battle fleet. However, the ship had numerous design problems that were made apparent during its shakedown cruise. </p1>
    <p2>These flaws, combined with the decreased urgency of the Boog threat, caused Starfleet to table its plans for a battle fleet and put the Defiant in storage.</p2>
    <p3>The Defiant prototype was pulled out of storage in 2371 when the Russian threat emerged. After several upgrades by Deep Space 9 Operations Chief Miles O'Brien, the ship was deemed worthy of use and more ships of the class were constructed.</p3>
